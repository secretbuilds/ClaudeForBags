Claude Code Skills to build better using BagsAPI

Add this file to your Claude Code as a Claude Skill

Claude Code is an IDE extension, or Terminal tool using Anthropic's Claude. It is an augement to a default IDE like Cursor, VS Code; and especailly more robust than Web based IDEs like Loveable, Bolt etc. 
Adding skills.md files to your source files in Claude Code will enable claude to do 2 things

1. Achieve consistency; every task that you need done, the same way every time, define the skills and tell Claude; especially useful for debugging
2. Teach new skills; don't let Claude waste time (and tokens) trying to "figure out" how to use an API or how to do anything at all, especially working with BagsAPI; just teach it in a file it can easily reference everytime, without fail.

Adding the BagsAPI skill will hopefully resolve alot of the issues, and questions you have, as your AI builder will know the capacity, the methods, and implications of using BagsAPI. 

Lets 100x these tokens :) Send me some of your token if this was helpful in your build; will hold
